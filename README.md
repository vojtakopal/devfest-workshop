## Getting first Vision API up running

Create your project in Google Cloud Console and assign billing to that project.

Sign in to your gcloud account with 

`gcloud auth login`

you can eventually setup your default project (if you have more of them) by

`gcloud config set project MY-PROJECT-ID`

then follow 

https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/quickstart-client-libraries 

Do not forget to enable Vision API. If the link from the quick start does not work, just go to the GCloud Console, and search for `Vision API` and enable it there.
